# Extrassentials
Extrassentials is a Spigot plugin I will be working on for awhile. It is inspired by Essentials in that it aims to provide for a variety of needs. It should be an "all-in-one" plugin, in a sense. That being said, it will have a very high degree of configurability, such that you do not need to have a bunch of things running if you only need a small portion of the plugin.

A couple things to note:
- Extrassentials will eventually be released on SpigotMC.org, but not until it has sufficient enough features to be useful to the general public.
- **Dev** builds are made automatically by GitHub whenever I make a change to the code. They may not work properly, or at all, but you may use them if you wish.
- **Release** builds are tested and working as expected. I might not always make new **Release** builds, even if the **Dev** build works (e.g. if it was a small change and I'd rather lump it into a bigger update).

The Wiki contains information about the actual functionality of the plugin (specifically the latest **Release** build -- not necessarily the latest **Dev** build).
